**The software and documentation for Version 1.0 of the Robot can be found [here](https://github.com/markwest1972/voice-controlled-zumo/releases/tag/v1.0).  Version 1.0 is a stable release of the Robot based upon an Arduino Uno, Zumo Shield and JCY-MY Bluetooth module.  More information about this release can be found in [this blog post](https://utbrudd.bouvet.no/2015/01/11/voice-controlling-a-robot-using-arduino-node-js-mqtt-websockets-johnny-five-and-html5-speech-recognition/)**

Version 2.0 of the Robot is currently under development.  This new version utilises a Raspberry PI, and adds WiFi and a USB Web Camera to the Arduino UNO.  There are many differences between version 1.0 and 2.0, for example the socket.io library is removed from version 2.0.

Note that the contents of the Master Branch will be unstable during the development process of version 2.0.
